# Rewards Store

This was the very last Ac√°mica project. Based off an  [Aerolab Challenge](https://aerolab.co/), I built an online fictionary point-based shop, in which you can purchase items in exchange for coins. You also have the ability to redeem more points, and view the history of purchased products. 

### Technologies used

- React
- Bulma CSS
- animate.css
- Scroll lock
- [Coding challenge's API](https://aerolabchallenge.docs.apiary.io/#reference/0/points/post?console=1)



You can see the deployed version of the app [here](https://jesuslencina.github.io/rewards-store-2/).
